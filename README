SETTING UP THE DATABASSE:
Copy and paste the sql file(name u21669831_sakila_dump.sql) into the mariaDB bin
The bin can be found here by typing this into the directory: C:\Program Files\MariaDB 10.7\bin
Once this has been done locate to the command prompt and run as administrator
Once in the comand prompt navigate to the mariaDB bin by typing: cd C:\Program Files\MariaDB 10.7\bin
Once inside the bin type the following to import the database: mysql -u root -p -D u21669831_sakila < u21669831_sakila_dump.sql
Where u21669831_sakila is the name of the database that you intend to import the data into and u21669831_sakila_dump.sql is the name of your dump
Enter your password
After that the database should be viewable inside mariaDB or mysql workbench


SETTING UP THE CONNECTION:
Before running the program connection information to the database must be changed
For simplicity inside the projects prac04\src\main\java\za\ac\up\cs\cos221 directory 
A few java classes can be found, inside the previously mentioned directory a file named connection.java can be found
In order to connect to your own personal database some text will need to be chnaged inside the file as follows:
Inside the classes constructor(named connection()) you will find 5 string variables named:
SAKILA_DB_HOST, SAKILA_DB_PORT, SAKILA_DB_NAME, SAKILA_DB_USERNAME, SAKILA_DB_PASSWORD

In order to access your own personal database instance you will need to change these variables as follows:
SAKILA_DB_HOST will need to be changed to your mariaDB's host name(for example 127.0.0.1 or localhost)
SAKILA_DB_PORT will need to be changed to your mariaDB's port number(for example 3306)
SAKILA_DB_NAME will need to be changed to the name of the database the program is reading from, in this case it will be u21669831_sakila if the database has been dumped correctly
SAKILA_DB_USERNAME will need to be changed to the username of your mariaDB instance(for example root)
SAKILA_DB_PASSWORD will need to be changed to your mariaDB instance's password(for example 1234)
After you've changed all these variables and set up the database you should be all good to go and run the programme
The above variables are for task 5 question 5.1
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
IF THE ABOVE IS NOT DONE CORRECTLY THE PROGRAMME WILL NOT RUN!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

RUNNING THE PROGRAMME:
Once the above instructions have been followed running the project is simple
Direct your cmd prompt into the file called prac04
For example cd C:\yourFilename\prac04
This will put you inside the prac04 directory
Once here execute these two commands
mvn install
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="za.ac.up.cs.cos221.App" or mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="za.ac.up.cs.cos221.movieStore"
This will evecute the programme
